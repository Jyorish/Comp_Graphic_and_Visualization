# Comp_Graphic_and_Visualization
While I approach designing software, I prioritize a couple of key aspects. Foremost among these is understanding the needs and requirements of the stakeholders and the specific problem they are trying to address with the software. Before this class, my exposure to computer graphics was limited to Photoshop. This course provided me with an opportunity to create a computer graphic and allowed me to acquire a valuable skill.
My design process is structured into three primary phases: understanding the project, development, and testing. Only when the testing phase meets my satisfaction or the requirements of the stakeholders does the project progress to the delivery phase, If not then it cycles back to the development phase. 
As future tasks arise that allow me to demonstrate my knowledge from this course, I will continue to adhere to this approach to design. 
With each project and milestone, my understanding of computer graphics and visualization has improved significantly. I have learned to create computer graphics using comprehensive lines of code, and I am proud to acquire this skill. Recreating the classic breakout games was a dream come true. This is just the beginning phase of my journey. Iâ€™ve several similar projects in my mind for the future. I will work on recreating a few of my favorite childhood games like Tank and Galaxy. I believe these future projects will enable me to leverage my skills and hone them.
